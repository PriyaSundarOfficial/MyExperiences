Exotic, beautiful and richly evocative of India’s colonial past, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are growing into a popular tourist destination. The 2 groups of islands, made up of the summits of a submerged mountain range, form India’s most remote state, located in the middle of the Bay of Bengal. This is one of the most beautiful and memorable trip in my life.This is one of the most beauitiful place i can suggeest for a holiday trip for relaxation and for enjoyment.Coming to the trip we planned the trip in TRAVEL TRIANGLE.One can choose this in order to enjoy the trip very peacefully .They will contact us through our contact number or through email.Based on our budget and duration of the trip they will plan the trip accordingly.As it was our first trip it is been on our memorable trip and we enjoyed alot.we planned this trip for our first year anniversery and it is been remained memorable trip. Coming to the trip we planned our trip for 7 days as per the guidence of the travel traingle.we visted andaman before the pandemic has been started i.e in 2020 in the month of feberuary.As it was my first experience to travel in flight i felt very ecxicted for the plane journey as well as the trip.The overall budget for our trip including flight tickets was arround 50k.Coming to the shopping ive planned the shoppping after we booked the package in travel traingle.I've started my shopping before a month off our trip.I and my hubby together had done our online shopping.I felt very happy about our cloth shopping because our costumes had given good look and  even instead apt for our photography.

FIRST DAY OF THE TRIP:Well we have started to he airport ealry mng arround 4am because our flight was arround 6am,so we reached to airport a the early at 5am. We have entered the airport an hour before the timing of the flight.We have completed the boarding after that we have gone arround the airport to have a look .In the mean while the flight time has came and we had enter the particular platform.Finally i ve seen the flight which we are about to travel,and felt very new and exicted about the travel in the flight.I have tried to take a picture at flight before we moved inside it,but unable to take a picture.We have entered into the flight and my hubby had booked me especially window side seat so that i will enjoy the trill of the flight journey.We have been seated in our seats by placing the seat belt and all,and there was a demo by the airhostes in case of an emergency landing or any danger occurs during the travel.The time has came for the flight to get started and there is an announcment by pilot and flight has entered on to the run way and started slowly and flighed into the air slowly and slowly it has gone up into the sky very high so that the things down are seen very small,i felt very thrilled by watching that view from the plane.we have travelled arroung 2 hours in the plane and finaly we landed safely i.e PORT BLIAR airport.
